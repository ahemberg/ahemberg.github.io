# Power RPI Zero with lithium batteries

## Background
I have been looking into powering my raspberry-pis with lithium batteries for quite a while now and looked at different
ways of achieving this. The most obvious way of doing this would be to buy some 18650 lithium batteries and hook them
up to the raspberry pi.

This requires voltage regulation to convert the 3.7 volts of the 18650 battery to 5 volts for the rpi. It also
requires some sort of protection circuitry to make sure that the battery is not discharged too deeply. On top of this
some solution for charging the battery is also required.

I therefore checked the prices of batteries in my local electronics store. It seemed that I could buy a 2600mAh 18650 cell
for around 150 SEK (~$15), a boost converter (voltage regulator-circuit) for 100 SEK and an easy to hook up charger-circuit from
AdaFruit for yet another 100 SEK. The battery included a protection circuit and I could therefore just hook it up via the
boost converter to the rpi without worrying about discharging the cell too much.

So all in all the grand total for this project would have ended up costing me c.a 350 SEK. That's all hunky dory but couldn't
we do better? I took a quick look around the store and found a power bank rated 2700 mAh* for 99 SEK and I quickly realized
that that would solve all my problems. It comes with an included charge and voltage regulation protection circuitry and an included
boost converter, it even came with a micro-usb cable.

So, the obvious solution to powering your rpi on the go is to just by a power bank, it's cheap, safe and ready to go out of the box.

## Checking out the power bank
This got me thinking however, the power bank contains all of the separate components that I talked about before:
a battery, a boost converter, protection and charger circuitry all at a third of the cost of buying the components by themselves.
Had I found a hole in the matrix? Or was the electronics store just ripping me off with the components? (tldr; yes).

I bought one and took it to bits.

Opening it revieled an 18650 cell of model [cell model] (datasheet can be found here [datasheet of batteries]) that
can be bought [here for X SEK/DOLLARS]. Pretty neat as we also got a control circuit for almost the same price. The quality
of this battery is probably not on par with an LG or Samsung cell

The other component inside is a circuit board based on a chip called [X]. This
is a typical lithium charge controller found in many chinese products. This circuit will take care of all the battery management
for us, and we don't have to worry about overcharging or deeply discharging the battery. It will also make sure that we get a stable
5V to the rpi.

## Modding the circuit board.
For my RPI-wifi sniffer project [LINK HERE] I would like to be able to have my rpi battery powered in a small box
and I would therefore like to avoid having USB-cables connecting the different units so I decided to use the power bank
with some modifications.

The rpi zero can be powered directly from the GPIO 5V pins. It does not have a polyfuse and the 5V pins connect directly
to the 5V pin of the usb-power socket. I therefore soldered pinheaders to the pi so that it is easy to connect the cables.

I now decided to get rid of the USB-socket on the power control board as i find it bulky and I will not be using it
anyway.

I leave the micro usb-socket attached so that I can still use it for charging. After the USB socket has been removed
there are now these bare solder pairs on the circuit board. I attached pin headers to these. I soldered them
to all four for greater stability, but it is only really necessary to solder to the two outer pads, as these are ground
and 5V respectively

I can now connect the two circuitboards together with two jumper wires and the RPI boots immediately. The next step
is to add measure the battery percentage directly from the rpi, more on that in [THIS BLOGPOST]

* I find this a little bit deceptive as this rating is for the battery inside the power bank. That battery is rated
2700 mAh at 3.7 volts. The power-bank supplies 5 volts however, so the actual rating would be closer to 2000 mAh if we
assume no losses in the circuitry (which we shouldn't, the efficiency is typically around 80-90%, giving us an effective
rating of 1600-1800 mAh). I would be much happier if they stated the capacity in Wh instead of mAh, thus getting rid of
the voltage dependency altogether.
